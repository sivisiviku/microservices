### Services and Routes ###

To add a new service, send a POST request to Kong Gatewayâ€™s Admin API /services route:
curl -i -s -X POST http://localhost:8001/services \
  --data name=service-one \
  --data url='http://service-one:3000'

curl -i -s -X POST http://localhost:8001/services \
  --data name=service-two \
  --data url='http://service-two:3001'

curl -i -s -X POST http://localhost:8001/services \
  --data name=service-three \
  --data url='http://service-three:3002'

Configure a new route to direct traffic:
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8001/services/service-one/routes \
  --data 'paths[]=/service-one' \
  --data name=service-one-route

curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8001/services/service-two/routes \
  --data 'paths[]=/service-two' \
  --data name=service-two-route

curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8001/services/service-three/routes \
  --data 'paths[]=/service-three' \
  --data name=service-three-route

To view the current state of a service, make a GET request to the service URL
curl -X GET http://localhost:8001/services/service-one

You can list all current services by sending a GET request to the base /services URL
curl -X GET http://localhost:8001/services

To view the current state of a route, make a GET request to the route URL:
curl -X GET http://localhost:8001/services/service-one/routes/service-one-route

The Admin API also supports the listing of all routes currently configured:
curl http://localhost:8001/routes

To patch service:
curl --request PATCH \
  --url localhost:8001/services/service-one \
  --data url='http://service-one:3000'
